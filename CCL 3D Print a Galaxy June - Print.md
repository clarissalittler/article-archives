**Can You 3D Print a Galaxy?**   
**A story about the limits of computation**

*Clarissa Littler*

What are the limits of what we can do with computers? They sure *seem* like they can do anything, limited only by storage and speed. What, though, are the problems we can *never* solve even with computers a quadrillion times better than now? 

Thus we set the scene for our little story, shifting ourselves in time and space to a far distant future: an age of hyper-tech and space travel with unimaginably fast computers and yottabytes of data that can fit in your palm. 

In specific, though, we find ourselves watching over the shoulders of three engineers---Adam Turing, Kat Goedel, and Gabriel Cantor---as they discuss their next big project: a machine that will be able to create stars, planets, and if our characters have their way, entire galaxies. 

I’ve chosen to bring us to the most interesting point of their long ranging discussion, the point at which our engineers realize that their goal of building a galaxy engine isn’t so sure a thing\!

Let’s listen…

\---

"I was doing some reading on 21st century technology and I had a bit of an odd thought," said Turing, hoping to get the rest of the group's attention. 

Cantor folded their translucent tablet and sighed. "And would you care to share what this odd thought **is**?" they ask with some annoyance. Goedel is staring at her tea, thinking. 

"Well, I was thinking: take away all the references to particle physics and a star builder is a lot like an old-fashioned 3d printer\! It's still a device that has to be told how to put things in places, but with quarks and electrons instead of plastic or metal." 

"That makes sense but I'm not sure how it's helpful." 

"Well, Cantor, the interesting thing is that since we want *one* machine to create a variety of objects we need to be able to *tell* it what to do; hence, it needs to be *programmable*\!" 

"But that would be a programming language for physics at small scales, for quantum mechanics itself\!" they ask. 

"Exactly\! Once we've got our programming language we'll be able to code up atoms, then stars, planets, and eventually galaxies\! The mechanics of the machine will almost certainly be trivial." 

At this point, Goedel interrupts the conversation. 

"That might be a problem, actually." 

"Why?" 

"Well, let's remember what three things need to be true for a problem to be computable? It needs to take finite time, use finite resources, and be written down in a finite length program." 

"Yes, obviously, but where's the problem?" 

At this point, Goedel holds up her thumb and forefinger with a little space between them. 

"How many points in space exist between my fingers?" she asks. 

"Well an infinite number of them\! Space is continuous, which means between any two points there’s always more points between them. That implies an infinite number\!" 

"And how many decimal places would you need to describe *each and every one* of them to perfect accuracy?" 

Cantor's eyes go wide as they say, "ah, of course, an *infinite* number of decimal places are needed." 

"Further," Goedel continues "there are at least as many configurations of an atom as there are points in space. There aren't enough programs to describe them all\!" 

"But aren't they both infinite?" Turing asks skeptically. 

"There are different *sizes* of infinity, though\!" Cantor points out. "The number of possible programs is the smallest infinity. The number of points between her fingers is the *next* smallest infinity in size, which is massively larger." 

Turing thinks for a moment. "That's rather disappoint—wait, but what *if* the universe is discrete instead of continuous? What if there are only a finite number of points between Goedel's fingers instead of infinite\!" 

Goedel frowns at this. "Yes but we have over 800 years of physics built around the assumption that space is smooth, continuous, with no gaps between points\!" 

"But that doesn't make it true\! We need to go talk to the physicists…" 

\----

What happened after this? Were Turing, Goedel, and Cantor ever able to build their engine? Even from my lofty vantage point, I don’t know the answer. What I *do* know is that people *are* working on understanding these very problems today and not in some hyper-tech future\! 

That brings us to the conversants in our trialogue: they were named after three important people in the history of computation: Alan Turing, Kurt Goedel, and Georg Cantor.
