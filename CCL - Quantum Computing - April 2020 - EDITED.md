# Quantum Computers: are they the future of computing?

For the past few decades, scientists have been slowly working on a new kind of computer, one not built on the simple zeros and ones in the binary computers we use today. They’re working on something very different, something stranger: a computer that operates on chance, not certainty. They’re called quantum computers. 

Quantum computers are the source of a lot of excitement and misunderstanding, so in this article I want to introduce what they are, what they are not, and what they might be able to do.

Binary computers perform operations on data with simple definite values. If we have the number five, for example, it is always equal to five. If we have five cats the number of cats never changes. If I add three cats to my five cats, there will always be eight cats. And a binary computer uses combinations of 0 and 1, called bits, to identify and store data like five, three, cats, and so on.

Quantum computers, on the other hand, are built on something a lot weirder than a bit: the quantum bit, or qbit for short. Data stored in the qbit determines the chance you will get a 0 or 1 when you ask for it out of the qbit. 

To explain qbits further, I’m going to need to take an aside into quantum mechanics---the science of how objects move and behave at very, very tiny scales. While in our everyday lives we’re used to things moving in straight lines from here to there, and moving through every point in between, things start acting differently at the scale of atoms or smaller. 

Quantum mechanics tells us that the tiny building blocks of atoms are particles, very tiny objects, but their movement and behavior is described by waves. When I say waves I mean something like sound waves or even ripples of water: shapes that exist in space and time.

Because these waves have shapes, these waves can be used to calculate the probability of where a particle will be, how fast it will be moving, things like that. And this probability, this chance, is real: if you were to test multiple particles that all had the same wave shape, you’d get different answers similar to someone rolling dice in the background. Quantum computing uses these wave probabilities, stored in a qbit, to determine the chance a qbit is a 1 or a 0\.

The comparison to sound waves is actually kinda useful because the same way noise canceling headphones generate one set of waves to interfere with other waves, you can have quantum probability waves interfere with each other. The most famous example of this is the double slit experiment which you can read about in a companion piece in this issue.

So back to quantum computers: we’ve described that qbits contain probability waves that describe the chance you get a 0 or 1 as a result. Because qbits contain much more complicated richer data than just a simple binary bit, a quantum computer can perform arithmetic and logical operations on these probability waves as easily as a normal computer acts on binary numbers.

This allows for some pretty cool things. Operations on qbits can get a lot more calculations done in a single step by ruling out wrong answers at the same time as working on possible right answers. This goes back to the wave interference thing. Good quantum algorithms include their own noise canceling headphones: they cancel out wrong answers and amplify right ones.

What are good quantum algorithms? What kinds of things can quantum computers do? The short answer is that we’re not sure because we haven’t studied them long enough.

The long answer is that we know quantum algorithms can do certain things faster, like break the public-key encryption that practically every site on the internet uses. That’s scary enough to make people want to study them more.

We do know that, in theory, quantum computers can’t do anything magical that an ordinary binary computer can’t perform. However, they potentially can do things much faster than our current computers. Something that would take years for a binary computer could take only minutes for a quantum computer.

The main obstacle right now is actually building a quantum computer that’s useful. We can construct some small computers with a few dozen qbits but they are unstable and only usable for short periods at a time. 

Even with those caveats, quantum computers are exciting. It’s this huge unknown world of new techniques, new kinds of hardware, and new ways to write software programs in the next few decades. Maybe you’ll be part of it\!
